<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p><small>So my dear Madam, you think Nursery Songs mere trash, not worth
utterance or remembrance, and beneath the dignity of the "march of mind"
of our days! I would bow to your judgment, but you always talk so loud
in the midst of a song; look grave at a joke&mdash;and the leaves of that
copy of Wordsworth's Poems, presented to you on your birthday&mdash;I will
not say how many years ago, still remain uncut. Facts like these, and
others constantly occurring, prove that your ear cannot relish melody;
and that poetry does not touch your feelings. Besides, you are still
unmarried, and you say, I record it with regret, "you hate children."
Doubtless you were never born a child yourself.</small></p>

<p><small>It is to mothers, sisters, kind-hearted aunts, and even fathers, who are
summoned to become unwilling vocalists at break of day by young
gentlemen and ladies of two years old; and to all having the charge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>children, who are alive to the importance of cultivating their natural
keenness for rhyme, rhythm, melody, and instinctive love for fun, that I
offer this first part of a collection of Traditional Nursery Songs. This
Collection has been in progress for more than ten years, and it is now
published, after a revision, with all the editions by Ritson, and
others, that I have been able to meet with.</small></p>

<p><small>The Pictures, though made especially for the benefit of my young
audience, will not, I feel pretty sure, be uninteresting to more
advanced connoisseurs. I am not at liberty to mention the names of the
artists who in their kind sympathies for children have obliged me with
them. It is a mystery to be unravelled by the little people themselves,
who, as they advance in a knowledge and love of beauty, will not fail to
recognize in the works of some of the best of our painters of familiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>life,
 the pencils of those who gave them early lessons in genuine art.</small></p>

Fair Felice.</i></p></blockquote>

</div>
<p><span class="smcap">N</span> the blessed time when Athelstan wore the crown of the English nation,
Sir Guy, Warwick's mirror, and the wonder of all the world, was the
chief hero of the age, who in prowess surpassed all his predecessors,
and the trump of whose fame so loudly sounded, that Jews, Turks, and
Infidels became acquainted with his name.</p>

<p>But as Mars, the God of Battle, was inspired with the beauty of Venus,
so our Guy, by no arms conquered, was conquered by love for Felice the
Fair; whose beauty and virtue were so inestimable, and shone with such
heavenly lustre, that Helen, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> pride of all Greece, might seem as a
Black-a-moor compared to her.</p>



<p>Guy resolving not to stand doting at a distance, went to Warwick Castle
where Felice dwelt, she being daughter and heiress to Roband Earl of
Warwick. The Earl, her father, hearing of Guy's coming, bade him
heartily welcome, and prepared to entertain him with a match of hunting,
but he to that lent an unwilling ear, and to prevent it feigned himself
sick. The Earl, troubled for his friend, sent his own physician to him.
The doctor told Guy his disease was dangerous, and without letting blood
there was no remedy. Guy replied, "I know my body is distempered; but
you want skill to cure the inward inflammation of my heart: Galen's
Herbal cannot quote the flower I like for my remedy. There is a flower
which if I might but touch would heal me. It is called by a pretty
pleasing name, and I think Phælix soundeth something like it." "I know
it not," replied the doctor, "nor is there in the Herbal any flower that
beareth such a name, as I remember."</p>

<p>So saying he departed, and left Guy to cast his eyes on the heavenly
face of his Felice, as she was walking in a garden full of roses and
other flowers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>





<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<blockquote><p><i>Guy courts Fair Felice; she at first denies, but after grants his
Suit on Conditions, which he accepts.</i></p></blockquote>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 45px;">
<img src="images/imggam15.jpg" width="45" height="450" alt="" title="decoration" />
</div>
<p>Guy immediately advanced to fair Felice, who was reposing herself in an
arbour, and saluted her with bended knees. "All hail, fair Felice,
flower of beauty, and jewel of virtue! I know, great princes seek to win
thy love, whose exquisite perfections might grace the mightiest monarch
in the world; yet may they come short of Guy's real affection, in whom
love is pictured with naked truth and honesty. Disdain me not for being
a steward's son, one of thy father's servants." Felice interrupted him
saying, "Cease, bold youth, leave off this passionate address; you are
but young and meanly born, and unfit for my degree: I would not my
father should know this." With this answer she departed from him.</p>

<p>Guy thus discomfited, lived for some time like one distracted, wringing
his hands, resolving to travel through the world to gain the love of
Felice, or death to end his misery.</p>

<p>Though Dame Fortune long may frown; when her course is run, she sends a
smile to cure the hearts that have been wounded by her frowns: so Cupid
sent from his bow a golden headed shaft and wounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> Felice; and to her
sight presented an armed Knight saying, "This Knight shall become so
famous in the world that Kings and Princes shall his friendship court."
When Felice found herself wounded, she cried, "O pity me, gentle Cupid,
solicit for me to thy mother, and I will offer myself up at thy shrine."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 47px;">
<img src="images/imggam08.jpg" width="47" height="450" alt="" title="decoration" />
</div>
<p>Guy little dreaming of this so sudden thaw, and wanting the balm of love
to apply to his sores, resolved to make a second encounter. So coming
again to his Felice, said, "Fair Lady, I have been arraigned long ago,
and now am come to receive my just sentence from the Tribunal of Love.
It is life, or death, fair Felice that I look for, let me not languish
in despair; give judgment, O ye fair, give judgment, that I may know my
doom. A word from thy sacred lips can cure my bleeding heart, or a frown
can doom me to the pit of misery."</p>

<p>"Gentle Guy," said she, "I am not at my own disposal, you know my
father's name is great in the nation, and I dare not match without his
consent."</p>

<p>"Sweet Lady," said Guy, "I make no doubt but quickly to obtain his love
and favour. Let me have thy love first, fair Felice, and there is no
fear of thy father's wrath preventing us."</p>

<p>"Sir Guy," quoth Felice, "make thy bold achievements and noble actions
shine abroad, glorious as the sun, that all opposers may tremble at thy
high applauded name, and then thy suit cannot be denied."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fair Felice," said Guy, "I ask no more. Oh that I were at work my task
to prove with some such churlish man as Hercules!"</p>





<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<blockquote><p><i>Guy wins the Emperor's Daughter from several Princes, and
returning to Warwick is sent forth by Felice to seek new
Adventures; but before his departure destroys a monstrous Dun Cow
upon Dunsmore Heath.</i></p></blockquote>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 45px;">
<img src="images/imggam15.jpg" width="45" height="450" alt="" title="decoration" />
</div>

<p>Our noble Guy, at last disengaged from Love's cruelty, now armed himself
like a Knight of Chivalry, and crossing the raging ocean, quickly
arrived at the Court of Thrace, where he heard that the Emperor of
Almain's fair daughter Blanch was to be made a prize for him that won
her in the field; upon which account the Worthies of the World assembled
to try their fortunes. The golden trumpets sounded with great joy and
triumph, and the stately pampered steeds pranced over the ground, and
each He there thought himself a Cæsar that none could equal. Kings and
Princes were there, to behold who should be the conqueror, every one
thinking that fair Blanch should be his.</p>

<p>After desperate charging with horse and man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> much blood was shed; and
our noble Guy laid about him like a lion, among the princes; here lay
one headless, another without a leg or an arm, and there a horse. Guy
still, like Hercules, charged desperately, and killed a German Prince
and his horse under him. Duke Otto, vowing revenge upon our English
champion, gave Guy a fresh assault, but his courage was soon cooled.
Then Duke Rayner would engage our favourite Knight, but with as little
success as the rest; and at length no man would encounter Guy any more:
so by his valour he won the Lady, in the field.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 47px;">
<img src="images/imggam08.jpg" width="47" height="450" alt="" title="decoration" />
</div>

<p>The Emperor, being himself a spectator, sent a messenger for our English
Knight. Guy immediately came into the Emperor's presence, and made his
obeisance, when the Emperor, as a token of his affection, gave him his
hand to kiss, and withal resigned to him his daughter, a falcon and a
hound.</p>

<p>Guy thanked his Majesty for his gracious favour; but for fair Felice's
sake, left fair Blanch to her father's tuition, and departed from that
graceful Court, taking with him only the other tokens of his victory.</p>

<p>Now Guy beginning to meditate upon his long absence from his fair
Felice, and doubting of her prosperity, or that she might too much
forget him, departed for England; and having at last arrived at the
long-wished for haven of his love, thus greeted his beloved mistress:
"Fair foe," said he, "I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> now come to challenge your promise, the
which was, upon my making my name famous by martial deeds, I should be
the master of my beloved mistress. Behold, fair Felice, this stately
steed, this falcon, and these hounds, part of the prize I have won in
the field, before Kings and Princes."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 45px;">
<img src="images/imggam15.jpg" width="45" height="450" alt="" title="decoration" />
</div>

<p>"Worthy Knight," quoth Felice, "I have heard of thy winning the Lady
Blanch from Royal Dukes and Princes, and I am glad to find that Guy is
so victorious. But thou must seek more adventures, earn yet a nobler
name, before I wed thee."</p>

<p>Guy, discomfited at this unlooked for answer, took leave of fair Felice,
clad himself again in Bellona's livery, and set forth on his travels.</p>

<p>While waiting for a fair wind to sail for France, Guy heard of an
exceeding great and monstrous Cow, four yards in height and six in
length, lurking within the woods not many miles from Warwick, and making
there most dreadful devastations. This Cow was of a Dun colour, and from
thence named the Dun Cow; and the place where she lay being on the
borders of a great Heath, was from thence called Dunsmore Heath, which
name it retains to this day.</p>

<p>Guy arming himself with his sword, a strong battle axe, and his bow and
quiver, rode to the place where this monster used to lurk, which was in
a thicket of trees, which grew on the side of a heath near a pool of
standing water; and being come within a bow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> shot of it the monster
espied him, and set up a dreadful roaring, enough to fill any heart with
terror. Guy nothing daunted bent his bow of steel; but his arrow
rebounded as from an adamantine wall, when the dreadful beast rushed at
him like the wind. Guy observing this, lifted up his battle axe and
smote her such a blow as made her recoil. Enraged yet more, she again
rushed at him, and clapping her horns upon his breast, dented his
armour, though of highest proof. Wheeling his warlike steed about, he
gave her a desperate wound under the ear, and following this stroke with
others no less forcible, at last he brought her to the ground. Then Guy
alighting from his horse hewed her so long, till with a horrid groan she
breathed her last.</p>



<p>The whole country, when they heard of the monster's death, came to
behold the dead carcase, and loaded Guy with thanks and presents; and
the King, after a splendid entertainment, gave him the Order of
Knighthood.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<blockquote><p><i>Guy, having performed great Wonders abroad, returns to England,
and is married to Felice.</i></p></blockquote>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 45px;">
<img src="images/imggam15.jpg" width="45" height="450" alt="" title="decoration" />
</div>
<p>Guy now set forth in search of further adventures, and performed many
acts of valour. Once after a tedious journey, being seated by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> spring
to refresh himself, he heard a hideous noise, and presently espied a
Lion and a Dragon, fighting, biting, and tearing each other. At length
Guy, perceiving the Lion ready to faint, encountered the Dragon, and
soon brought the ugly Cerberus roaring and yelling to the ground. The
Lion, in gratitude to Guy, run by his horse's side like a true born
spaniel, till lack of food made him retire to his wonted abode.</p>


<p>Soon after Guy met with the Earl of Terry, whose father was confined in
his Castle by Duke Otto; but he and that Lord posted thither, and freed
the Castle immediately; and Guy in an open field slew Duke Otto, whose
dying words of repentance moved Guy to remorse and pity.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 47px;">
<img src="images/imggam08.jpg" width="47" height="450" alt="" title="decoration" />
</div>

<p>After this, as Guy returned through a desert, he met a furious boar that
had slain many Christians. Guy manfully drew his sword, and the boar
gaping, intending with his dreadful tusks to devour our noble champion,
Guy thrust it down his throat, and slew the greatest boar that ever man
beheld.</p>



<p>On Guy's arrival in England, he immediately repaired to King Athelston
at York, where the King told Guy of a mighty Dragon in Northumberland,
that destroyed men, women, and children. Guy desired a guide, and went
immediately to the Dragon's cave; when out came the monster, with eyes
like flaming fire. Guy charged him, courageously;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> but the Monster bit
the lance in two like a reed; then Guy drew his sword, and cut such
gashes in the Dragon's sides, that the blood and life poured out of his
venomous carcase. Then Guy cut off the head of the monster, and
presented it to the King, who in the memory of Guy's service, caused the
picture of the Dragon, which was thirty feet in length, to be worked in
a cloth of arras, and hung up in Warwick Castle for an everlasting
monument. Felice, hearing of Guy's return and success, came as far as
Lincoln to meet him, where they were married with much joy and great
triumph; King Athelstan, his Queen, and all the chief Nobles and Barons
of the land being present.</p>


<p>No sooner were their nuptials celebrated, but Felice's father died,
leaving all his estate to Sir Guy, whom the King thereupon created Earl
of Warwick.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<blockquote><p><i>Guy leaves his Wife, and goes a Pilgrimage to the Holy Land.</i></p></blockquote>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 45px;">
<img src="images/imggam15.jpg" width="45" height="450" alt="" title="decoration" />
</div>
<p>In the very height of Guy's glory, when he was exalted to his father's
dignities, conscience biddeth him repent of all his former sins; so Guy
resolved to travel to the Holy Land like a Pilgrim.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> Felice, perceiving
his melancholy, inquired of her Lord the cause of this passion? "Ah,
Felice!" said he, "I have spent much time in honouring thee, and to win
thy favour; but never spared one minute for my soul's health in
honouring the Lord."</p>


<p>Felice, though very much grieved, understanding his determination,
opposed not his will. So with exchange of rings, and melting kisses, he
departed, like a stranger from his own habitation, taking with him
neither money nor scrip; while but a small quantity of herbs and roots,
such only as the wild fields could afford, formed his chief diet; and he
vowed never to fight more, but in a just cause.</p>

<p>Guy, after travelling many tedious miles, met an aged person oppressed
with grief, for the loss of fifteen sons, whom Armarant, a mighty Giant,
had taken from him, and held in strong captivity.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 47px;">
<img src="images/imggam08.jpg" width="47" height="450" alt="" title="decoration" />
</div>
<p>Guy borrowed the old man's sword, and went directly up to the Castle
gate, where the Giant dwelt, who coming to the door, asked grimly, "How
he durst so boldly knock at the gates?" vowing he would beat out his
brains. But Guy, laughing at him, said, "Sirrah, thou art quarrelsome;
but I have a sword that has often hewn such lubbards as you asunder." As
he spoke he laid his blade about the Giant's shoulders, so that he bled
abundantly; who being much enraged, flung his club at Guy with such
force, that it beat him down; and before Guy could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> recover his fall
Armarant had got up his club again. But in the end Guy killed this broad
backed monster, and released divers captives that had been in thraldom a
long time; some almost famished, and others ready to expire under
various tortures; who returned Guy thanks for their happy deliverance.
After which he gave up the Castle and keys to the old man and his
fifteen sons; and pursued his intended journey, and coming to a grave,
he took up a worm-eaten skull, which he thus addressed: Perhaps thou
wert a Prince, or a mighty Monarch, a King, a Duke, or a Lord! But the
King and the Beggar must all return to the earth; and therefore man had
need to remember his dying hour. Perhaps thou mightest have been a
Queen, or a Dutchess, or a Lady varnished with much beauty; but now thou
art wormsmeat, lying in the grave, the sepulchre of all creatures.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 45px;">
<img src="images/imggam15.jpg" width="45" height="450" alt="" title="decoration" />
</div>

<p>While Guy was in this repenting solitude, fair Felice, like a mourning
widow, clothed herself in sable attire, and vowed chastity in the
absence of her beloved husband. Her whole delight was in divine
meditations and heavenly consolations, praying for the welfare of her
beloved Lord, whom she feared some savage monster had devoured. Thus
Felice spent the remainder of her life in sorrow for her dear Lord; and
to show her humility, she sold her jewels and the costly robes with
which she used to grace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> King Athelstan's Court, and gave the money
freely to the poor; she relieved the lame and the blind, the widow and
the fatherless, and all those that came to ask alms; and built a large
hospital for aged and sick people, that they might be comforted in their
sickness. Thus she laid up for herself treasure in heaven, which will be
paid again with life everlasting.</p>


<p>In the mean time Guy travelled through many lands, and at last in the
course of his journeying he met the Earl of Terry, who had been exiled
from his territories by a merciless traitor. Guy bade him not be
dismayed, and promised to venture his life for his restoration. The Earl
thanked Guy most courteously, and they travelled together against
Terry's enemy. Guy challenged him into the field, and there slew him
hand to hand, and restored the Earl to his lands. The Earl full of
gratitude begged to know the name of his champion, but Guy insisted upon
remaining unknown; neither would he take any reward for his services.
Thus was the noble Guy successful in all his actions, until finding his
head crowned with silver hairs, after many years travel, he resolved to
end his days in his native country: and therefore returning from the
Holy Land, he came to England. On his arrival he found the nation in
great distress, the Danes having invaded the land, burning cities and
towns, plundering the country, and killing men, women, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> children;
insomuch that King Athelstan was forced to take refuge in his invincible
city of Winchester.</p>





<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<blockquote><p><i>Guy fights with the Giant Colbran, and having overcome him,
discovers himself to the King, then to his Wife, and dies in her
Arms.</i></p></blockquote>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 45px;">
<img src="images/imggam15.jpg" width="45" height="450" alt="" title="decoration" />
</div>
<p>The Danes, having intelligence of King Athelstan's retreat to
Winchester, drew all their forces thither; and seeing there was no way
to win the city, they sent a summons to King Athelstan, desiring that an
Englishman might combat with a Dane, and that side to lose the whole
whose Champion was defeated. On this mighty Colbran singled himself from
the Danes, and entered upon Morn Hill, near Winchester, breathing
venomous words, calling the English cowardly dogs, whose carcases he
would make food for ravens. "What mighty boasting," said he, "hath there
been in the foreign nations of these English cowards, as if they had
done deeds of wonder, who now like foxes hide their heads."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 47px;">
<img src="images/imggam08.jpg" width="47" height="450" alt="" title="decoration" />
</div>
<p>Guy, hearing proud Colbran, could no longer forbear, but went
immediately to the King, and on his knee begged a combat; the King,
liking the courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> of the pilgrim, bade him go and prosper. Whereupon
Guy departed out of the North gate to Morn Hill, where Colbran, the
Danish Champion, was. When Colbran espied Guy he disdained him, saying,
"Art thou the best Champion England can afford?" Quoth Guy, "It is
unbecoming a professed Champion to rail; my sword shall be my orator."
No longer they stood to parley, but with great courage fought most
manfully; but Guy was so nimble, that in vain Colbran struck; for every
blow fell upon the ground. Guy still laid about him like a dragon, which
gave great encouragement to the English; until Colbran in the end
growing faint, Guy brought the Giant to the ground. Upon which the
English all shouted with so much joy, that the welkin rang again. After
this battle the Danes retired back again to their own country.</p>



<p>King Athelstan sent for this Champion to honour him; but Guy refused
honours, saying, "My Liege, I am a mortal man, and have set the vain
world at defiance." But at the King's earnest request, on promise of
concealment, Guy discovered himself to him; which rejoiced Athelstan's
heart, and he embraced his worthy Champion. But Guy took leave of his
Sovereign, and went to seek a solitary cave, wherein to spend the
remainder of his life. From time to time he repaired to Warwick Castle,
and received alms at the hands of his dear Lady, who showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> more bounty
to pilgrims than any lady in the land besides.</p>


<p>At length finding his hour draw nigh, he sent a messenger to Felice,
with a gold ring, at the sight of which token she hastened to her Lord.
And Guy soon after died in the arms of his beloved Felice, who, having
survived him only fifteen days, was buried in the same grave.</p>


<p><i>Now is the Story brought to an end of Guy the bold Baron of price, and
of the fair maid Felice.</i></p>
